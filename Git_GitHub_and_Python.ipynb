    "## Instructions:\n",
    "Use this Thanksgiving dataset to explore patterns in the family dining habits.\n",
    "You’ll need to _**interpret**_ the data using summary statistics, **not just report them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will being using **only the describe function** to answer your questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Looking at the minimum and maximum values of Age, what do they suggest about who attended this Thanksgiving dinner? <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The youngest person was 6 years old and the oldest was 80, suggesting there was a wide spread of ages that attended this dinner.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Looking at the mean and standard deviation of Dinner_Duration, what do they show about how consistent the mealtime was across family members? <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** It shows an average mean of 2.36 and a standard deviation of 0.61, showing that most people spent around the same time eating across family members.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If someone stayed for 4.8 hours, would you consider them an outlier? _Use the mean and standard deviation to support your answer (Hint: $mean + 2*std$ OR $IQR=Q3−Q1$ and $Upper Bound=Q3+1.5×IQR$)._ <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** Yes, they would be an outlier because using the equation given, the upper bound gives 3.73 hours, which means 4.8 is an outlier.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Compare the mean and median of Dinner_Servings. What could a large difference between them indicate about family member behavior? _(Hint: 50% is half way in the data set)_ <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The mean (3.62) and median (4) are close, showing that the data is most likely symmetrical.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Looking at the max value of Dessert_Servings, what type of guest do you imagine that might be and what could this tell us about dessert consumption overall?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** It would most likely be a child or someone with a sweet tooth. This could show how spread out the data is due to the observations.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Suppose the standard deviation of Dinner_Serving is small. What does that suggest about how much everyone ate?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** Since the std of dinner servings is small, it suggests that everyone ate around the same. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Which statistic (min, max, mean, std) best helps you find the “light eaters”? Explain how you would identify them and if the minimum makes sense.<br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The min and mean would help find the light eaters because if they are closer to the min then they are lighter eaters compared to the mean.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "8. The range (max − min) of Dinner_Duration is quite large. What could that imply about how the dinner was organized?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The dinner could have been organized as a buffet-style, making some families stay longer compared to others. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "9. You suspect that older guests tend to eat fewer desserts. Could you use only the `describe` function to explore whether that idea might be true before doing a full analysis or would we have to include something else?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** No, because you would need more than just the describe function, because you would need to see the correlation with Age vs Dessert_Servings<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What does the mean tell you about how common it was for people to watch the Macy’s Day Parade?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** Since the mean is 0.5, it shows that half the group watched it, but it wasn't something everyone watched.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "11. what does the standard deviation suggest about the variation in watching behavior? Was parade-watching behavior fairly consistent across people, or was there a lot of difference between individuals?  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The standard deviation of 0.51 shows that there was a wide split of people who did watch and people who didn't watch it at all. This shows mixed behavior in watching.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "12. In one sentence, summarize what kind of Thanksgiving this dataset represents. Focus on what the numbers imply rather than just stating the numbers.  <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** The dataset represents a family Thanksgiving dinner with similar eating habits, meal durations, and an even split between people who watched the parade and people who didn't.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "13. Suggest some visuals that would be ideal for exploring this data and state their purpose. <br>\n",
    "**Answer:** Histogram for Age and Dinner Duration to see if there is a trend with how long people stay at the table due to age, Scatter plot for age vs Dessert_Servings so we can see whether age has anything to do with the consumption,<br>\n"
